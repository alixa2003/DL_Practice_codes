# DL_Practice_Codes

Welcome to **DL_Practice_Codes** — a curated collection of my Deep Learning practice implementations. This repository serves as a personal archive and learning resource where I explore core concepts, architectures, and applications of deep learning.

## 📘 Contents

This repository includes:

- 📌 Basic neural networks using TensorFlow 
- 🧠 Implementation of popular architectures (CNNs, RNNs, LSTMs, etc.)  
- 🔍 Experimentation with training techniques and optimizers  
- 📊 Evaluation metrics and performance tracking  
- 💡 Mini-projects and problem-specific solutions  

## 🛠 Tools & Frameworks

- Python 3.x  
- TensorFlow / Keras  
- NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn (for data handling and visualization)

## 🚀 Purpose

- Reinforce theoretical understanding through code  
- Practice real-world model building and tuning
